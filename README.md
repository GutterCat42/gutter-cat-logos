# All the gutter cats!!!
For historical posterity.

Maybe I'll even create a gutter cat policy/regulation/license eventually. Or even add the origin story of the gutter cat at some point? Or more never-before-seen-on-dvd reveals?

NOTE: this isn't the most organised repository at the moment. In fact, it's rather incomplete. I will clean it up one day. Maybe.

## blobs-with-guns:
Yeah that's the 'gutter cat with a gun' that I used in my game, Blobs with Guns.

## french:
Various french french gutter cats. What's the issue? Includes .pdn files for editing in paint.net.

## gradients:
I like gradients okay? Also includes .pdn files for editing in paint.net.

## grey-cat:
A grey stylised gutter cat based off the artstyle a friend got me to help with when making a game. Includes a 4k version because why not.

## hyper-modern:
A "hyper-modern" style of gutter cat logo another friend asked for. Is it truly "hyper-modern"? Not really. But I don't do modern.
Anyway, this was the first vector gutter cat that I created in Inkscape and it includes a .svg file for editing in Inkscape or another editor of your choice.

## monaco:
I really like the game *Monaco: What's Yours is Mine* okay? Includes a .pdn file because I created it in paint.net.

## original:
You know, that classic gutter cat. Inlcudes various sizes and version with and without the blue background and/or text. I created these ones in Piskel, so it includes a .piskel file.

That same .piskel file here actually consists of several gutter cats in different frames of the Piskel sprite. They are, in order: classic no text, classic with text, bwg cat with gun, grey cat, and constuction cat (made for yet another friend's game).
Construction cat does not have it's own folder for some reason. Maybe I'll add that later.

## shape-shooter:
What's that? A game I started making but never finished? It couldn't be. Well, here are three .pdn files (I have no idea why I needed three) from the game that nearly was but actually wasn't. Maybe I'll come back to it one day.

Also, something about the cat looks off and I can't quite pick it. I dunno, I'm not an artist.

## sophisticated-cat:
It's exactly what it sounds like. I stole stock images of a top hat and monocle and there we go. Includes .pdn file for paint.net.

## text-based:
Yeah I have to come clean. The 'original' gutter cat isn't actually the original. Maybe I should rebrand it to 'classic'. Well, anyway, this text-based version of the cat is the real original.

It includes a .txt file of the text cat (although something about the spacing isn't right. I'll fix it one day).
Also includes a .py file that simply prints out the logo - also with my 'collaborator' for the first ever gutter cat game, 'Anomalous Potato' (that's one of my friends' names not my game's name don't worry).

(I put 'collaborator' in single quotes because they were just literally one of my friends and we decided it looked fancier with two names instead of one. I don't remember what they helped me with other than with the text logo. Sorry friend.)
